# WebSerial for Firefox

WebSerial API Polyfill for Mozilla Firefox browser

## Introduction

This add-on allows to use the WebSerial API in Firefox.

It uses a native application to communicate with serial ports.

**NOTE:** Currently, the add-on only works on Windows and Linux (x86-64).

## Installation

The add-on is available for download from Mozilla Addons:
[WebSerial for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/pl/firefox/addon/webserial-for-firefox/).

The native application needs to be installed on the computer first. The GUI will offer to download the
native application when you first try to open a serial port.

### Installation on Windows

The .exe file is an installer - just open it and install the native application.

### Installation on Linux

Run script:

```sh
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kuba2k2/firefox-webserial/master/native/install/linux_x86_64.sh | bash
```

#### or install manually

1. Put the downloaded file in `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts`
2. Rename it to just `firefox-webserial`.
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x ~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/firefox-webserial`.
4. Create a file named `io.github.kuba2k2.webserial.json` in the same directory, with this content:
	```json
	{
		"name": "io.github.kuba2k2.webserial",
		"description": "WebSerial for Firefox",
		"path": "/home/USER/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/firefox-webserial",
		"type": "stdio",
		"allowed_extensions": ["webserial@kuba2k2.github.io"]
	}
	```
	Adjust `/home/USER` to match your username.
5. Restart the browser and use the extension.

**NOTE:** On Alpine Linux (or other musl-based distros) you will need to have `gcompat` installed.
